# Locomotion Mediator

Behavior that mediates user locomotion by providing [Locomotion Provider](locomotion-providers.md) components with access to the [XR Body Transformer](xr-body-transformer.md) linked to this behavior. This behavior manages the [Locomotion State](xref:xri-locomotion#locomotion-state) for each provider based on its requests for the Body Transformer.
