# Interaction components

The topic in this section describe the components used to create interactions with 3D objects. These components include various types of interactors and interactables as well as manager and utility components for the interaction system.

| **Topic**             | **Description**         |
| :-------------------- | :----------------------- |
| [XR Interaction Manager](xr-interaction-manager.md) | A manager component required in every scene. |
| [XR Interaction Group](xr-interaction-group.md)     | A component that defines a group of interactors. You can order the group to determine which interactor takes precedence when more than one interactor in the group tries to initiate an interaction. |
| [Interactors](interactor-components.md)             | The interactor components provided by the toolkit. |
| [Interactables](interactable-components.md)         | The interactable components provided by the toolkit.|
| [Filters](filter-components.md)                     | The filter components provided by the toolkit.|
| [AR Interactables](ar-interactable-components.md)   | The AR interactable components provided by the toolkit.|
| [Affordances](affordance-components.md)             | The affordance components provided by the toolkit.|
